## RsyncOSXsched

![](icon/menuapp.png)

This is the `menu app` (RsyncOSXsched.app). The menu app is a helper application for executing scheduled tasks in RsyncOSX. Scheduled tasks are added in RsyncOSX. Quit RsyncOSX and let the menu app take care of executing the scheduled tasks. RsyncOSX does **not** execute scheduled tasks. Scheduled tasks are only added and deleted in RsyncOSX. The `menu app` is started from RsyncOSX.

### Screenshots

The menu app is a simple app with a few screens. The one and only task for the menu app is to execute scheduled RsyncOSX tasks. Every time a task is executed a notification is submitted.

If there are tasks waiting for executing the status light is green.
