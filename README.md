## RsyncOSXsched

![](icon/menuapp.png)

This is the `menu app` for executing scheduled tasks in RsyncOSX. Scheduled tasks are added in RsyncOSX, quit RsyncOSX and let the menu app take care of executing the scheduled tasks. RsyncOSX does **not** execute scheduled tasks.

The `menu app` should be started from RsyncOSX. This require paths for both apps to be entered into userconfiguration.  The paths are used for activating the apps from either within RsyncOSX or RsyncOSXsched. Adding paths for applications automatically enables, if both apps are found, executing scheduled apps in the `menu app`. To disable delete paths.

The `menu app` submit a notification when a scheduled tasks is completed. A scheduled task is either of type `once`, `daily` or `weekly`.

The status light is green indicates there are active tasks waiting for execution.

There is a minimal logging in the menu app. The menu app logs the major actions within the menu app.

### Signing and notarizing

The app is signed with my Apple ID developer certificate and [notarized](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491) by Apple. If you have Xcode developer tools installed executing the following command `xcrun stapler validate no.blogspot.RsyncOSXsched RsyncOSXsched.app` will verify the RsyncOSX.app.
```
xcrun stapler validate no.blogspot.RsyncOSXsched RsyncOSXsched.app
Processing: /Volumes/Home/thomas/GitHub/RsyncOSXsched/Build/Products/Release/RsyncOSXsched.app
The validate action worked!
```
This is the message when opening a downloaded version.

The message is in Norwegian: "Apple har sjekket programmet uten Ã¥ finne ondsinnet programvare.". The english version of it is: "Apple checked it for malicious software and none was detected.".

#### SwiftLint

As part of this version of RsyncOSX I am using [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) as tool for writing more readable code. There are about 125 classes with 15,000 lines of code in RsyncOSX (too many?). I am also using [Paul Taykalo swift-scripts](https://github.com/PaulTaykalo/swift-scripts) to find and delete not used code.

### Compile

To compile the code, install Xcode and open the RsyncOSXsched project file. Before compiling, open in Xcode the `RsyncOSXsched/General` preference page (after opening the RsyncOSXsched project file) and replace your own credentials in `Signing`, or disable Signing.

There are two ways to compile, either utilize `make` or compile by Xcode. `make release` will compile the `RsyncOSX.app` and `make dmg` will make a dmg file to be released.  The build of dmg files are by utilizing [andreyvit](https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg) script for creating dmg and [syncthing-macos](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing-macos) setup.
